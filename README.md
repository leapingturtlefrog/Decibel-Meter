## Decibel Meter
A simple tool for visualizing loudness over time and at an instant. Also includes a waveform analyzer in the bottom-left corner that graphs the sound waves captured for each frame.
NOTE: The conversion from raw audio values to decibels is off because I only created the equation with a few values for comparison.

I made this because I'm fascinated by sound, especially loud sounds, which are often overlooked despite being highly common in our lives without us even realizing it.

An example of background noise:

Versus a steady sound (note the difference in the wave analyzer):
